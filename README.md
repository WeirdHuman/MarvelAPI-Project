# Marvel-API-Project
This project consists of many important features of Javscript such as fetching data from an API using REQUEST-PROMISE library in order to make two API calls at the same time. Furthermore, this project also involved in working with Javascript newer syntax; specifically the arrow function as well as THEN and Catch for handling error. Most importantly, the project also working with fundamental concepts of Javascript such as declaring varible and using loop to loop through array of data that coming back from the Marvel API and then take the data to view engine.

## Built With
This Marvel API project was created by using HTML, CSS, Javascript on the front-end.
Node-JS: Javascript runtime that let you interact with Javascript code outside the browser.
Express-JS: Application framework for Node-JS since we are working with API this is NEEDED.
Request-Promise: This was used for making request and getting data from the API.
Body-parser: Body-parser was used in order to get the data from the Request that was made.
EJS Template Engine: EJS was used for generating HTML template to display the request data.

## Instruction for Marvel-API-Project
This is an open project for everyone to come and experience. For everyone, who would love to check out this project. First and foremost, you must obtain your own confidential API key and use the MD5 Hash generator to generate the hash key; more info can be found on Marvel Developer Portal. THIS IS NEEDED BECAUSE I HAVE NOT DEPLOY THIS APPLICATION LIVE YET THEREFORE THIS CAN ONLY BE RUN ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE. After obtaining the key, you are all set and ready to rock and roll with the application. For the application itself, it is very simple and straight-forward. There are only two pages for this project, main-page and the hero-page. For the main-page, it displays the featured characters that will be upcoming release from Marvel and the search hero form. Now onto the fun stuff, for the search hero, let say you would like to look up a Marvel hero for example Thanos, one of my favorite character from Marvel. The hero-page will pop-up and it will shows your searched hero along with their description, images, and comics fronts and that are the bulk of the application functionalities. 

## Prerequisites
As you can see, you will need to install Node-JS, Express-JS, EJS, Body-Parser and most importantly Request-Promise in order for this project to be running properly.
