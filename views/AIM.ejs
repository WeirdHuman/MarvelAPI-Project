Strucker fought for Germany during World War I, during which he first encountered the jewel "Momentary Princess," which was fated to appear and disappear at regular intervals of time.

In 1936 he and Geist, one of Hitler's top men, allied themselves with the Egyptian mentalist Amahl Farouk-secretly the Shadow King-in an attempt to dispute the lineage of England's royal family and install a new king who would be sympathetic to the Nazis.
